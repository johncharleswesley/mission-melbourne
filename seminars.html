      <h1>Economics for Christians</h1>
      <h2>Professor Ian Harper (9C) and Dr Rose Humberstone (10P)</h2>
      <p>Christians often struggle to see God in economics, a field which seems to consider greed a virtue when the Bible explicitly condemns greed as idolatry. Yet economics dominates so many aspects of our daily lives, so how can we think 'Christianly' about this topic? Can economics be redeemed by the Gospel?

      <h1>Poverty &amp; Justice</h1>
      <h2>Mr Peter Clout (9C) &amp; Ms Alison Preston (11C)</h2>
      <p>This session will consider the centrality of the concept of justice by looking at Matthew 6:9-13 - The Lord's Prayer. This prayer is so familiar that many of us have stopped hearing it. The talk will focus on each line of the prayer and attempt to hear it with the ears of those who first heard it all those years ago. For example what did the exhortation "Your kingdom come" or "Give us this day our daily bread" mean to those who heard Christ's words and why might it be important to recapture this? What are the key concepts the prayer is inviting us to think about?  What actions is this prayer calling us towards? How does this change our relationships with God and with others? There will be opportunities for reflection and discussion and also some options for further consideration of these issues through resources and ongoing discussion.</p>

      <h2>Dr Ian Barns (9C) &amp; Anna Radkovic (UC)</h2>
      <p>How does God look at this earth that he created and what is our role in caring for it in view of the Fall and on Christ’s return? How do we resisting a culture of over-consumption and consumerism in collective practical ways? What we can learn from the 'Transition movement' - both in terms of the practical initiatives they encourage, and also the framework of 'head, heart and hands' that they deploy in doing so? Together we will engage and draw you into some of their questions, concerns and how God is challenging them to respond.</p>

      <h1>Materialism</h1>
      <h2>Assoc. Prof Catherine De Fontenay (9C) &amp; Mr Joshua Morrin (UC)</h2>
      <p>How is the modern obsession with possessions and physical comfort above all else affecting us and how do Christians best respond? Are we to adopt the ascetic life and eschew any or all readily available comforts? Are there possessions we need to give up, and are there possessions we can really use for God's glory, without that being a rationalisation? We invite you to consider with us how we can truly submit our "material" to Christ's service.</p>

      <h2>Mrs Fran Boydell (9C) &amp; Mr Stephen Ireland (UC)</h2>
      <p>“Boat people, illegals, asylum seekers, irregular arrivals” – who are the people that come to our shores and how does the gospel call Christians to respond? As the issues associated with record human movements appear to be stifling in their complexity, beyond the rhetoric and politics are real people, families and loved ones. We must ask what the recent debate has revealed about Australia and the hearts of its people, and consider how followers of Jesus can go about breaking the collective stalemate on refugees and asylum seekers.</p>

      <h2>Rev Dr Lindsay Wilson (9C/Ridley) &amp; Julia Harper (5P)</h2>
      <p>It is difficult today to present a Christian view about sexual identity or marriage without being accused of being old-fashioned or homophobic. Is it possible that Christians can be counter-cultural in these matters without coming across as bigoted or offensive? How can we remain true to the Bible’s teaching and still show genuine care and acceptance of those who think and act differently? What needs to change and what can’t be changed?</p>

      <p>How can we as a nation achieve reconciliation with the indigenous people of this land? We have said sorry for the ‘stolen generation’, but we have not yet said sorry for the stolen land and the lasting damage that has caused.</p>
      <p>What should the church do to help our nation to act? What does the Bible say on these matters, and how does this issue relate to our gospel responsibilities? How can we say sorry, when the actions were done by others? And how can we best help indigenous Christians to provide leadership in these matters? </p>

      <p>The nations have come to our doorstep and the opportunities for cross-cultural outreach within Australia are now broader than ever. As we befriend people from other religious backgrounds, we often find that they are eager to know what we believe and understand more of the gospel. But befriending people from other cultures can be difficult – we will consider how we can welcome people from other cultures and religions, and share our lives with them.</p>

      <h1>Christianity in the Workplace</h1>
      <h2>Ms Kara Martin (Ridley) &amp; Mr Rob Martin (10P/CBF)</h2>
      <p>For centuries people worked to live, but now we have the opportunity to live to work. This shift can dangerously make work an idol,  God as our source of status, meaning, significance, purpose, control and security. Furthermore, fear of the secular world has meant that Christians and churches can unconsciously perpetuate a split between the sacred and the secular.</p>
      <p>Work's meaning is more than an opportunity for evangelism or to provide resources to pay for professional Christians. What is the significance of being made in the image of a working God, who invites us to complete the act of creation in filling and being stewards of the world? We need to recover the balance between the curse of work and the good of work, and be creative in finding ways to rediscover the biblical view of work.</p>

      <blockquote><p>According to Jesus, by far the most important thing about praying is
to keep at it.</p>— Frederick Buechner</blockquote>
      <blockquote><p>Prayer is simply a two-way conversation between you and God.</p>— Billy Graham</blockquote>
      <blockquote><p>The function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.</p>— Soren Kierkegaard</blockquote>

      <p>What is prayer? Do you find it hard to pray? Do you think you need to be transformed in order to pray? Do you ever wonder how prayer transforms? Or who it transforms? A session to raise questions and stimulate discussion, encourage us to pray and explore different ways of praying.</p>

      <h1>Mediation</h1>
      <h2>Mr James Hornby (10P/5P) &amp; Mrs Fran Salvestrin (9C)</h2>
      <p>We are lovingly commanded to “Be still before the Lord, and wait patiently for him” (Psalm 37:7), calling us to stop and be still in His presence – a place of refuge and protection from any and all strife. In this world of distractions responding through meditation is not easy for many of us and your experience of meditation techniques may have left you with doubts about God's sanction on this practice. We will consider various ways we can still the body and prepare ourselves to listen to God’s word, and how we may pray through and meditate on Scripture.</p>
